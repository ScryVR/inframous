# Inframous

## Summary

For some reason, I like to build projects according to [this guide](https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-a-website-with-modern-tooling-and-no-frameworks-a33e65099f9). The only annoying thing is performing the initial steps.
This package makes it easy to set up these projects using a CLI command.

**NOTE**: The original guide doesn't use Typescript, but this package does.

## How to use

Install this package.

```bash
npm install -g inframous
```

Create new projects using the inframous command.

```bash
mkdir your-project-folder
cd your-project-folder
inframous
```
